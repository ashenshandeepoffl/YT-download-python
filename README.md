This program uses the pytube library to create a YouTube object from the user-provided link. It then gets a list of available video streams that are available for progressive download. The user is prompted to select the desired video quality from the list of available streams. Once the video stream is selected, the program prompts the user for the download path and then downloads the video to that location.

To use this program, you'll need to install the pytube library

pip install pytube
